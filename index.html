      <h2>How to Cook</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large bucket or pot, submerge the chicken pieces in the pickle juice. Refrigerate for 24 hours (or up to 3 days).</li>
          <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the pickle brine and submerge it in the buttermilk. Refrigerate for another 4 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour with the spices. Generously season chicken all over with salt and pepper. Toss chicken pieces throuroughly in flour, shaking off excess. Place on a rack on a track, ready to fry.</li>
          <li>Heat 10 cm (4 inches) of oil in a deep fryer or large, deep heavy-duty saucepan <strong>(Make sure to use a heavy duty cast iron pot no more than half full, "because it'll fuckin boil over and smash your skin")</strong> over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer reads 300-325°F / 150-160°C.</li>
          <li>Working in batches, fry the chicken, turning occasionally, until it is cooked through and brown, 15 minutes for white meat, 20 minutes for dark meat. Drain on a cooling rack fitted over a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt, and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with hot sauce, lemon wedges, and the bread.</li>
